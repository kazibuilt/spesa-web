</p>  <p> <strong>FDIC Insurance</strong>
Current is a financial technology company, not an FDIC-insured bank. FDIC insurance only covers the failure of an FDIC-insured bank. FDIC insurance up to $250,000 is available on customer funds through pass-through insurance at Choice Financial Group, Member FDIC, and Cross River Bank, Member FDIC where we have a direct relationship for the placement of deposits and into which customer funds are deposited, but only if certain conditions have been met.  There may be a risk that FDIC insurance is not available because conditions have not been satisfied. In such cases, funds may not be fully insured in the event the insured depository institution where the funds have been deposited were to fail.
</p> <p> <strong>Faster Direct Deposit</strong>
Faster access to funds is based on comparison of traditional
              banking policies and deposit of paper checks from employers and
              government agencies versus deposits made electronically. Direct
              deposit and earlier availability of funds is subject to timing of
              payer's submission of deposits.
